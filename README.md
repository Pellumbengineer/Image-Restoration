# Image-Restoration

## EVALUATION 

1. Read in ‘pout_noisy.tif’ image from the images directory. It is a noisy image with a periodic noise.

2. Displaying the noisy image and its shifted Fourier spectrum side by side.

3. Applied a bandreject filter to remove the noise in the image, as much as we can.

4. Displaying bandreject filtered image and its inverse Fourier transform side by side.

# Image-Restoration

## EVALUATION 

1. Read in ‘pout_noisy.tif’ image from the images directory. It is a noisy image with a periodic noise.

2. Displaying the noisy image and its shifted Fourier spectrum side by side.

3. Applied a bandreject filter to remove the noise in the image, as much as we can.

4. Displaying bandreject filtered image and its inverse Fourier transform side by side.

5. Applied notch filters to remove the noise in the image, as much as we can.

6. Displaying notch filtered image and its inverse Fourier transform side by side.
